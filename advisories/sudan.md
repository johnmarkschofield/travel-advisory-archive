**There was no change to the advisory level. The "health" risk indicator was added. Advisory summary was updated.**

**Advisory summary  
**The U.S. Embassy in Khartoum suspended its operations in April 2023 due to the outbreak of armed conflict in Sudan. The U.S. government cannot provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Sudan due to the current security situation.

To report an emergency regarding a U.S. citizen in Sudan, contact U.S. Embassy Cairo at +20-2-2797-3300. Or contact the Department of State at +1-888-407-4747 from the United States and Canada or +1-202-501-4444 from elsewhere in the world.

**Unrest - Armed Conflict  
**Armed conflict continues in Sudan. This includes heavy fighting among the Sudanese Armed Forces, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, and various armed militias. The situation is violent, volatile, and extremely unpredictable, particularly in the Kordofan and Darfur regions, as well as in the capital region, including Khartoum and Omdurman.

Khartoum International Airport is currently closed to commercial traffic, while commercial service to the Port Sudan International Airport has been limited at times due to drone strikes. Electrical and communication disruptions can occur at any time. This includes internet and cell phone service interruptions.

**Crime  
**Crime, including kidnapping, assault, armed robbery, home invasion, looting, and carjacking, is a common threat throughout the country. Checkpoints might occur at any time, some of which may be legitimate security checkpoints, others may intend to loot, others may present a risk to particular populations.

**Terrorism  
**Members of known terrorist groups and individuals sympathetic to these groups can attack with little or no warning. They may target foreign and local government facilities as well as areas frequented by travelers.

**Landmines  
**Landmines are a threat, as much of Sudan is an active war zone. There are widespread reports of unexploded ordnance posing a threat in Khartoum and elsewhere in the country, even after fighting has ended in those areas.

**Health  
**Medical services in Sudan are extremely limited. Adequate medical treatment for routine and emergency procedures is often not available. Even minor health issues could require medical evacuation at the traveler's expense. Make sure you have medical or travel insurance that includes medical evacuation. Review our information on [Travel Insurance](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/planning/guidance/insurance.html). Check with your doctor about required vaccines and shots for high-risk exposure before you go to Sudan.

  * Exercise extreme caution in all parts of the country, including Khartoum.
  * Have a plan to leave in an emergency that does not depend on U.S. government help. Review our information on [crisis and evacuations](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/help-abroad/crisis-response.html).
