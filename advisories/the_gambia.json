This is most common in the Banjul area and tourist spots.\n\nDo not display cash and valuable personal property. Avoid walking alone, including on beaches, in tourist areas, and after dark.\n\n**Unrest  \n**A separatist rebel group operates in the Casamance region of southern Senegal. There has been sporadic fighting along The Gambia\u2019s southern border in the recent past. Stay on main roads and do not travel at night if travelling near or across the southern border.\n\n**Health**  \nThe Gambia\u2019s health infrastructure is inadequate. Health services, hygiene, and quality control do not meet U.S. standards of care. Pharmacies are not well regulated. Locally available medications may be unsafe.\n"
