  "content_md": "Exercise increased caution in Bosnia and Herzegovina due to **terrorism, crime,  **and**  land mines**.\n\n**Country Summary:  **Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas. Theft and other crimes of opportunity are common, especially against tourists. Violent crimes, such as robbery and murder, also occur due to the availability of firearms remaining from the war. Minefields and land mines are present throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. While suspected hazardous areas are normally clearly marked, several people are killed or injured each year.\n\nRead the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/BosniaandHerzegovina.html) for additional information on travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina:  \n\n  * Be aware of your surroundings and maintain situational awareness when traveling to tourist locations and crowded public venues.\n  * Monitor local media for breaking events and adjust your plans based on new information.\n  * Remain on hard-surfaced roads and stay out of abandoned buildings due to risks from land mines.\n  * Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://step.state.gov/step/) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n  * Follow the Department of State on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/) and [X/Twitter](https://x.com/travelgov). \n  * Review the [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Country/BosniaHerzegovina/Detail) for Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  * Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices) related to your travel.\n  * Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.
