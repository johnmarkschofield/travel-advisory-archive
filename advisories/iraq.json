Do not travel to Iraq for any reason.**\n\n**Country Summary:**  U.S. citizens in Iraq face high risks, including violence and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. militias threaten U.S. citizens and international companies. Attacks using improvised explosive devices, indirect fire, and unmanned aerial vehicles occur in many areas, including major cities. The Department of State requires U.S. government personnel in Iraq to live and work under strict security due to serious threats. \n\nThere is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Iraq. Visit the U.S. Department of State's [country reports on terrorism](https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/) to learn more.\n\nDemonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently throughout the country. These events can develop quickly without prior notice, often interrupting traffic, transportation, and other services, and sometimes turn violent.\n\nDo not travel near armed groups or Iraq's northern borders due to:\n\n  * Continued threat of attacks by terrorist groups\n  * Armed conflict\n  * Aerial bombardment\n  * Civil unrest\n\n\n\nU.S. citizens should not travel through Iraq to engage in armed conflict in Syria, where they would face extreme personal risks (kidnapping, injury, or death) and legal risks (arrest, fines, and expulsion). The Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq has stated it will impose prison sentences of up to ten years on individuals who illegally cross the Iraq-Syria border. Fighting on behalf of or providing other forms of support to designated terrorist organizations can constitute the provision of material support to a foreign terrorist organization, which is a crime under U.S. law that can result in penalties including prison time and large fines.
