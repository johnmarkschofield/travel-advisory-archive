JNIM is linked to al-Qa'ida. JNIM mostly operates in the Sahel region, including Burkina Faso and Mali.  The threat from JNIM has in the past reached northern Cote d'Ivoire, near the border with Burkina Faso.  Attacks have happened in the Savanes and Zanzan Districts, including Comoe National Park.  These attacks have mainly targeted Ivoirian security forces, but civilians have also been targeted.  In 2021, Al-Qa'ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) carried out 17 small-scale attacks that killed approximately 20 people.  After these attacks, the Cote d'Ivoire government increased security in northern Cote d'Ivoire.  Since 2021, there have been no attacks.\n"
