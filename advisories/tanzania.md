  * Demonstrations can be unpredictable.
  * The Tanzanian government increases security presence around protests. This includes stationary checkpoints and roadblocks.
  * The Tanzanian government limits or does not authorize large gatherings.



**Crime  
**Violent crime is common. It includes assault, sexual assault, robberies, mugging, and carjacking. Local police have limited resources to respond effectively to serious crime.

**Terrorism  
**There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Tanzania. Visit the U.S. Department of State's [country reports on terrorism](https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/) to learn more.

The risk of terrorist violence is most common in the Mtwara Region.

**Targeting of gay and lesbian individuals  
**Members of the gay and lesbian community have been arrested, targeted, and harassed. People who identify as gay or lesbian may experience a higher likelihood of being targeted by police. People detained under suspicion of same-sex sexual conduct may face invasive physical exams.
