Exercise increased caution in Cote d'Ivoire due to **crime, terrorism, unrest, health** , and **piracy** in nearby waters. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory. 

**Do Not Travel to the northern border region due to risks of crime and terrorism**.

**Advisory summary**

Do not travel to the northern border region of Cote d'Ivoire for any reason.

**U.S. government employee travel restrictions**

The U.S. government has a limited ability to provide routine or emergency services to U.S. citizens outside of Abidjan. U.S. government employees working in Cote d'Ivoire are not allowed to drive outside major cities at night and require two-car convoys for official travel outside of coastal and major north/south highways. U.S. citizens are advised to take the same precautions.

**Crime**

Crime continues to be a concern in Cote d'Ivoire. Violent crime, including carjacking, robbery, and home invasion, is common in some areas. Local police often lack resources to respond to serious crimes. Stay aware of your surroundings in urban areas and crowded markets. Police roadblocks may be present throughout the country, and though not common recently, unofficial roadblocks may be encountered in some locations.  

**Terrorism**

There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity, in Cote d'Ivoire. Visit the U.S. Department of State's [country reports on terrorism](https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/) to learn more.

Terrorists may attack without warning:

  * Spots frequented by foreigners anywhere in the country 
  * Night clubs
  * Schools
  * Hotels
  * Restaurants
  * Places of worship
  * International diplomatic missions
  * Local security forces and civilians



**Unrest**

Travelers should avoid demonstrations, protests, political rallies, and large crowds.  These events can become violent. Demonstrators and security forces may clash suddenly. Police may use tear gas or other force to break up crowds.

**Health**

  * Health facilities are available in major cities, although medical services for routine and emergency procedures may be limited. Health infrastructure in rural areas of Cote d'Ivoire is less adequate. Health services, including routine and emergency procedures, are often unavailable or may not meet U.S. standards of care. Hospitals and doctors may require payment up front prior to service or admission.
  * There are often shortages of medicine, medical supplies, and basic resources in public and private health facilities. Pharmacies are not well regulated.  Locally available medications may be unsafe.



**Piracy**

Ships at sea near Cote d'Ivoire are vulnerable to major threats from piracy, armed robbery, and kidnapping for ransom. U.S. citizens on vessels in the Gulf of Guinea off West Africa should stay alert. 

**Level 4: Do Not Travel**

**Do Not Travel to areas of northern border region due to crime and terrorism**

The main terrorist threat to Cote d'Ivoire is from a group called Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM). JNIM is linked to al-Qa'ida and mostly operates in the Sahel region, including Burkina Faso and Mali. In the past, JNIM has crossed the border from Burkina Faso to conduct attacks in northern Cote d'Ivoire.  Attacks have occurred in the Savanes and Zanzan Districts, including Comoe National Park. These attacks have mainly targeted Ivoirian security forces, and sometimes civilians.

Al-Qa'ida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) has carried out small-scale attacks in northern Cote d'Ivoire. After these attacks, the Ivoirian Armed Forces formed the Northern Operational Zone (ZON) to protect the region, and the government established the Counterterrorism Operational Intelligence Center (CROAT) and International Counterterrorism Academy (AILCT) as part of a national effort to stop terrorism. There have been no recent known incidents of violent extremism in the region, although risks remain along the northern border and in the northeast corner of Cote d'Ivoire.
