**_Reissued after periodic review with minor edits._**

Exercise increased caution due to **crime, civil unrest, and the risk of kidnapping.**  Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory. 

Do not travel to:

  * The Colombia-Peru border area in the Loreto Region due to **crime**. 
  * The Valley of the Apurimac, Ene, and Mantaro Rivers (VRAEM), which includes Vilcabamba, due to **crime** and threats of **terrorism**.   
  * Some areas within the regions of Ayacucho, Cusco*, Huancavelica, and Junin, due to **crime** and threats of **terrorism**.   



* **The city of** **Cusco and popular tourist sites nearby, like the Sacred Valley, the Inca Trail, and Machu Picchu, are not located in the affected area.  **  

**Country Summary:**  Crime is common in Peru. Petty theft, carjackings, muggings, assaults, and other violent crime often happen even in daylight hours and with many witnesses around. Kidnapping is rare, but it does occur. The risk of crime increases at night. Criminal groups sometimes set up roadblocks to rob people in areas outside of Lima. 

**Ayahuasca and Kambo Usage  
**U.S. travelers should not use Ayahuasca or Kambo because of the known dangers. U.S. citizens have suffered serious illness and, in some cases, died after taking these drugs. They have also been sexually assaulted, injured, or robbed while under the influence of these substances.   

**Demonstrations  
**Demonstrations occur regularly throughout the country. Public demonstrations can take place for a variety of political and economic issues.   Demonstrations can shut down local roads, trains, and major highways. This often happens without warning or clear information on reopening times.  Road closures can limit access to public transportation and airports. Closures may also disrupt travel in and between cities. 

**Due to road safety risks, U.S. government employees working in Peru are prohibited from nighttime driving** except within cities, between Lima and Huacho (to the north), and Lima and Paracas (to the south). U.S. government employees working in Peru may travel at night with commercial bus companies along the Pan-American Highway, to Huaraz, and on the Lima-Arequipa-Cusco corridor.
