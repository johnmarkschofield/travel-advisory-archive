Exercise increased caution when traveling to Turkiye due to terrorism and arbitrary detentions. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Do Not Travel To:**

  * Sirnak province, Hakkari province, and any area within six miles (10 kilometers) of the Syrian border due to terrorism.



**Country Summary:  **Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Turkiye. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations. Be cautious in transportation hubs, markets, malls, and government buildings, as well as hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, and parks. Be careful in airports and at major events.

Security forces have detained tens of thousands of people, including U.S. citizens, for alleged ties to terrorist groups based on scant or secret evidence and grounds that appear to be politically motivated.  U.S. citizens have also been subject to exit bans that prevent them from departing Turkiye. Protests not approved by the Turkish government can lead to arrest, as can criticizing the government, including on social media.
