The Department has determined that the risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by the Eritrean government exists.\n\nEritrean law enforcement officials routinely block access by U.S. government officials to U.S. citizens in detention.  The U.S. Embassy therefore may not receive notification of your arrest or be allowed access to you if you are detained or arrested.\n\nThere are landmines in many remote areas in Eritrea, particularly in Nakfa, AdiKeih, Arezza, the 25 mile-wide region (40 km) between the Setit and Mereb Rivers, and in areas north and west of Keren, areas near Massawa, Ghinda, Agordat, Barentu, Dekemhare, and south of Tessenae.\n\nRead the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Eritrea.html) for additional information on travel to Eritrea.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Eritrea:\n\n  * Use caution when walking and hiking in remote areas or off main roads.\n  * Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location.\n  * Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://step.state.gov/step/) ([STEP](https://step.state.gov/step/)) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n  * Follow the Department of State on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/travelgov) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/StateDept?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor).\n  * Review the [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report) for Eritrea.\n  * Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.  Review the [Traveler's Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/checklist.html).\n  * Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) related to your travel.\n\n\n"
