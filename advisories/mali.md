**For U.S. citizens in Mali:**

  * The Department of State urges U.S. citizens not to travel to Mali.
  * Have a plan to leave in an emergency that does not depend on U.S. government help. Review our information on [Crisis and Evacuations](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/help-abroad/crisis-response.html).
  * Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization. Consider consulting with a professional security organization.
  * Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://mytravel.state.gov/s/step) to get important updates and alerts from the U.S. embassy. Enrolling helps the U.S. embassy contact you or your emergency contact in an emergency.
  * Review the Overseas Security Advisory Council [OSAC Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Country/) for Mali.
  * Monitor local media for breaking news. Be prepared to adjust your plans.
  * Draft a will. Designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or draft a power of attorney.
  * Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care or custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.
  * Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones. This helps them manage your affairs if you cannot return to the United States.
  * Develop a communication plan with family, your employer, or host organization. This helps them monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. Specify how you'll confirm you're safe (text, calls, etc.), how often, and who you'll contact first to share the information.
  * Identify key sources of possible help for you and your family in case of emergency, such as the local U.S. embassy or consulate, FBI, the State Department, your employer (if traveling on business), and local friends or family in the high-risk area. 
  * Choose one family member to serve as the point of contact. If you are kidnapped or taken hostage, that person can communicate with kidnappers or hostage-takers, media, U.S. or foreign government agencies, and members of Congress.
  * Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones. If you are taken hostage, your loved ones will know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to confirm that you are being held captive and alive.
  * Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them for identification purposes.
  * Use all available safety measures in your home or hotel, always including locking doors and windows, and setting the alarm.
  * If asked to stop by police, stop only in well-lit areas or places where several officers are posted.
  * Before you travel, delete any sensitive photos, comments, or content that might be seen as controversial or inappropriate in your destination. Do this for your social media accounts, cameras, laptops, phones, and other accounts and devices.
  * Leave your expensive or sentimental belongings behind.
  * Refer to our list of [medical providers](https://ml.usembassy.gov/services/#local).
  * Make sure your insurance includes medical evacuation coverage.
  * Check with your doctor about required vaccines and shots for high-risk exposure before you go to Mali.
  * We highly recommend that you buy travel insurance before you travel. Check with your [travel insurance provider](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/planning/guidance/insurance.html) about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancelation coverage.
