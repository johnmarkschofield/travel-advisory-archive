  "content_md": "_There was no change to the advisory level. The \"Health\" risk indicator was added. Advisory summary was updated._\n\n \n\nDo not travel to the Central African Republic due to risk of **unrest,** **crime, kidnapping, landmines, health,** and **terrorism.**\n\n**Advisory summary**\n\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the Central African Republic.\n\n  * U.S. government employees working in the Central African Republic must get special authorization to travel outside of Bangui. They are required to travel in armored vehicles in Bangui and are subject to a curfew.\n  * Family members cannot join U.S. government employees who work in the Central African Republic.\n\n\n\n**Unrest**\n\nThere is a continuing risk of civil unrest, demonstrations, and election-related violence. This includes renewed outbreaks of armed conflict occurring throughout the country.\n\n  * Unrest can happen in the capital of Bangui.\n  * Armed groups and opposition forces control large areas of the country. They regularly kidnap, injure, or kill civilians.\n  * Airport, land border crossings, and road closures may occur without warning.\n\n\n\n**Crime**\n\nViolent crime is common. It includes homicide, kidnapping, armed robbery, aggravated battery, and larceny.\n\n**Kidnapping**\n\nCriminal gangs and armed groups kidnap for ransom on a frequent basis, mainly outside of Bangui. Local law enforcement officials are not equipped or trained to handle the threat of kidnapping.\n\n**Other - Landmines**\n\nUnexploded landmines are unmarked. They are a known risk. Landmines may be present anywhere outside Bangui, particularly:\n\n  * Along the border with Cameroon\n  * In the tri-border region with Chad in Sector West\n  * Near Bambari in Sector East\n\n\n\n**Health**\n\nMedical services in the Central African Republic are extremely limited. There is no adequate medical treatment available for routine and emergency procedures. Even minor health issues could require medical evacuation at your expense.\n\n  * Make sure you know if your health insurance plan covers any medical expenses coverage abroad. Most U.S. plans do not. \n  * If you purchase medical travel insurance, you are responsible for seeking reimbursement from your medical insurance. Be sure to follow their guidance and instructions for filing claims. \n  * We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/planning/guidance/insurance.html) to cover medical evacuation. \n\n\n\n**Vaccinations**\n\nMake sure you are up to date on all routine vaccines before every trip.  Travelers are required to show proof of yellow fever vaccination for all arriving travelers (at least 9 months old). CDC recommends that travelers going to the Central African Republic take prescription medicine to prevent malaria.\n\nStay up to date with the vaccines recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\n\n  * [CDC Travelers' Health](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list)\n  * [World Health Organization Travel Advice](https://www.who.int/travel-advice)\n\n\n\n**Terrorism**\n\nIneffective border controls may allow criminal and terrorist groups to seek temporary refuge in the Central African Republic. Be alert to your surroundings. Terrorists can attack without warning. They may target foreign and local government facilities as well as tourist areas.\n\n**For citizens in the Central African Republic** :\n\n  * Review our information on [Travel to High-Risk Areas](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/travel-advisories/high-risk-areas.html).\n  * Review our information on [Crime Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/travel-advisories/crime.html) and for [Victims of Crime](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/help-abroad/victims-crime.html).\n  * Have a plan to leave in an emergency that does not depend on U.S. government help. Review our information on [Crisis and Evacuations](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/help-abroad/crisis-response.html).\n  * Review our information on [Terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/travel-advisories/global-events/terrorism.html).\n  * There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in the Central African Republic. Visit the U.S. Department of State's [Country Reports on Terrorism](https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/#crt) to learn more.\n  * Due to the risk of landmines, avoid travel to rebel-controlled areas near the border with Cameroon and Chad.\n  * Monitor local media for breaking news. Be prepared to adjust your plans.\n  * Stay aware of your surroundings.\n  * Avoid demonstrations and crowds.\n  * Keep a low profile.\n  * Stay alert in tourist spots.\n  * Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.\n  * Develop a communication plan with family, your employer, or host organization. List how and when you'll confirm you're safe (text or call). Specify how often you'll do this.\n  * Draft a will. Designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or draft a power of attorney.\n  * Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones. If you are taken hostage, your loved ones will know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to confirm that you are being held captive and alive.\n  * Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them for identification purposes.\n  * Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.\n  * Use caution when walking or driving at night.\n  * Do not display signs of wealth, like expensive watches or jewelry.\n  * Do not answer your door at your hotel or residence unless you know who it is.\n  * Stay alert when visiting banks or ATMs.\n  * Make sure your insurance includes medical evacuation coverage.\n  * Bring enough supply of over the counter and prescription medicines to cover the duration of the trip.\n  * Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://mytravel.state.gov/s/step) to get important updates and alerts from the U.S. government. Enrolling helps the U.S. government contact you or your emergency contact in an emergency.\n  * Review the [Country Security Report for CAR](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/ec7088ab-8d38-4df1-bb99-1c8e3afc6ee5).\n  * Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for the latest [Travel Health Information for CAR](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/central-african-republic).\n  * Whether you're a first time or frequent traveler, use the [International Travel Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/planning/checklist.html).\n  * We highly recommend that you buy travel insurance before you travel. Check with your [travel insurance provider](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/planning/guidance/insurance.html) about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancelation coverage.\n\n\n"
