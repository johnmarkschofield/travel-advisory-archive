Read the entire Travel Advisory.\n\nViolent crime, such as armed robbery, assault, carjacking, and homicide, is common. Local police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious criminal incidents.\n\nHealth facilities are under-resourced and may not have adequate facilities or supplies of basic vaccines or medications, especially outside of large cities.  Always travel with required medicines, including a written prescription for any prescription medicine; most medicine is unavailable, and healthcare is inconsistent.  \n\nRead the [Country Information Page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Angola.html) for additional information on travel to Angola.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Angola:\n\n  * Review [CDC's Travelers' Health Angola](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/angola). \n  * Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.\n  * Use caution when walking or driving at night.\n  * Keep a low profile.\n  * Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program ](https://step.state.gov/step/)([STEP](https://step.state.gov/step/)) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n  * Follow the Department of State on [Facebook ](http://www.facebook.com/travelgov) and [X/Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/travelgov).\n  * Review the [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Browse/Report?subContentTypes=Country%20Security%20Report) for Angola.\n  * Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations.
