Reconsider travel to Bangladesh due to **civil unrest, crime,  **and **terrorism**. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.  
  
**Level 4: Do Not Travel**

  * The Khagrachari, Rangamati, and Bandarban Hill Tracts districts (collectively known as the Chittagong Hill Tracts) due to **communal violence, crime, terrorism, kidnapping, and other security risks**.



**Country Summary:  **Since summer 2024, **civil unrest** and violent clashes have largely subsided with the formation of the Interim Government.  Occasional protests continue with potential for violent clashes.  Conditions may change on short notice.  U.S. citizens are reminded to avoid all gatherings, even peaceful ones, since they could turn violent with little or no warning.

Travelers should be aware of petty **crime,**  such as pickpocketing in crowded areas.  In addition, crimes such as muggings, burglaries, assaults, and illegal drug trafficking constitute most criminal activity in Bangladesh's major cities, but there are no indications foreigners are targeted because of their nationality.  These crimes tend to be situational, based on time and location.

There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Bangladesh.  Visit the U.S. Department of State's [country reports on terrorism](https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/) to learn more.

Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Bangladesh are prohibited from non-essential travel within Dhaka outside of the diplomatic enclave.

Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Bangladesh must obtain special authorization to travel outside of Dhaka. Authorization is not required for travel to Cox's Bazar or Sylhet.

The U.S. government may have limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Bangladesh, particularly outside of Dhaka, due to these travel restrictions, a lack of infrastructure, and limited host government emergency response resources.

If you decide to travel to Bangladesh:

  * Avoid demonstrations and political gatherings; demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and quickly escalate into violence. 
  * Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust plans.
  * Do not physically resist any robbery attempt. Get to a safe area and report any criminal incident to local authorities.
  * Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://step.state.gov/step/) ([STEP](https://step.state.gov/step/)) to receive alerts including updates on consular services and so it is easier to locate you in an emergency.
  * Review the [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/249e43e5-d5e6-4506-86bf-1ce7eab76dec) for Bangladesh.
  * Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information ](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list)related to your travel.
  * Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Please review the [Traveler's Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html).
  * We highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel.  Check with your travel insurance provider about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.
