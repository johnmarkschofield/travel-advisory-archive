**Advisory summary**

**Crime**  
Violent crime, such as armed robbery are common in urban areas, crowded markets, and public beaches. Local police lack the resources to respond effectively to serious crimes.

If traveling outside the capital city of Monrovia, try to finish your trip during daylight hours. It's safer to avoid travel at night due to safety and security concerns. 

**Unrest**  
Demonstrations occur regularly. They have on occasion resulted in violence or use of tear gas by authorities.

Large-scale demonstrations related to the local political situation may  
occur with little notice. Demonstrations may disrupt transportation  
and other essential services

**Health**

  * The health infrastructure in Liberia is inadequate. Health services, hygiene, and quality control do not meet U.S. standards of care. 
  * Pharmacies are not well regulated. Locally available medications may be unsafe.
  * Medical services for routine and emergency procedures are limited. Health facilities are available in major cities. It may be harder to find adequate health care in rural areas.
  * Public medical clinics lack basic resources and supplies.



Review the Health section of the Travel Guidance on this page for more information.

**U.S. government employee travel restrictions**

  * U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling outside the capital or between counties after dark due to the safety and security risk. The only exception is travel to and from Roberts International Airport.
