**_Updated to include a risk indicator for health and updates to crime._**

Exercise increased caution in Namibia due to **crime** and**health** risks.

**Country Summary:  **Potentially violent crimes, such as home invasions, break-ins, muggings, and "smash and grabs" from vehicles stopped at intersections, parked near common tourist areas, or located in shopping mall parking lots are increasingly common. Crimes of opportunity, primarily the theft of money, cell phones, and personal property, are common.

Namibia is sparsely-populated and many visitors travel to remote areas far from emergency services and medical facilities. Health facilities are limited and may not have adequate supplies of basic medications, especially outside of large cities.
