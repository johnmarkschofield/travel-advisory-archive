Exercise increased caution in Eritrea due to **travel restrictions, limited consular assistance, landmines,** and**wrongful detentions.**

**Country Summary:** The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Eritrea, as U.S. government employees must obtain special authorization to travel outside of Asmara.

U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Eritrea, including dual U.S.-Eritrean nationals, have been arrested and detained without charge or on false charges.  The Department has determined that the risk of wrongful detention of U.S. nationals by the Eritrean government exists.

Eritrean law enforcement officials routinely block access by U.S. government officials to U.S. citizens in detention.  The U.S. Embassy therefore may not receive notification of your arrest or be allowed access to you if you are detained or arrested.

There are landmines in many remote areas in Eritrea, particularly in Nakfa, AdiKeih, Arezza, the 25 mile-wide region (40 km) between the Setit and Mereb Rivers, and in areas north and west of Keren, areas near Massawa, Ghinda, Agordat, Barentu, Dekemhare, and south of Tessenae.
