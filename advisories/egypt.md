Exercise increased caution

in **Egypt** due to **terrorism** , **crime** , and **health**. Some areas have increased risk. 

  * The U.S. Embassy has limited ability to help dual national U.S.-Egyptian citizens who are arrested or detained.
  * Egyptian law considers dual citizens to be solely Egyptian citizens.



**Terrorism**

There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Northern and Middle Sinai Peninsula. Visit the U.S. Department of State's [country reports on terrorism](https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/) to learn more. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning: 

Egyptian authorities generally offer effective security protection. However, extremists continue to express interest in planning and carrying out attacks. Security is generally present at potential targets, which include: 

  * Religious sites (mosques, churches, monasteries, and buses traveling there) 
  * Local government buildings, and diplomatic facilities (embassies) 
  * Tourist sites 
  * Transportation centers 
  * Shopping malls 
  * Restaurants and foreign businesses 
  * Resorts 
  * Roadside checkpoints 
  * Urban areas in Cairo 



**Crime**

Most crimes against foreigners are crimes of opportunity, like purse snatching and pickpocketing. Harassment of women, including foreigners, is a problem in Egypt. It can include vulgar comments, gestures, indecent exposure, and unwanted physical contact. Tourists should beware of overcharging and scams in tourist areas. Review the [Country Security Report for Egypt](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/f9535564-b44b-40f6-971b-1c31033d9a55) for further details. 

**Health**

Emergency and intensive care facilities are limited in Egypt and may be unavailable in remote areas. Ambulances are rare, unreliable in most areas, and don’t have advanced medical equipment. 

**Global polio**

Some international destinations, including Egypt, have circulating poliovirus. Before traveling to Egypt, make sure you are up to date on your polio vaccines. Check the [CDC website for current vaccination recommendations](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/egypt).

**Demonstrations**

Protests or demonstrations may occur suddenly: 

  * Individuals have been arrested for being in the vicinity of protests in Egypt, even when not actively participating. 
  * U.S. citizens have been arrested for participating in protests. 
  * You may be detained for posting anything on social media seen as critical of Egypt or its allies, or for disrespecting its cultural sites. 
  * Local law prohibits protesting or demonstrating without a permit. 



**Do not travel to:**

  * The Northern and Middle Sinai Peninsula due to **terrorism.**
  * The Western Desert due to risk to **safety and security unless traveling with a professionally licensed tour company.**
  * Egyptian border areas due to **military zones****.**
