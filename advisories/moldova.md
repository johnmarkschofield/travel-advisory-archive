**Transnistria - Level 3: Reconsider Travel**

Transnistria. There is also military conflict in nearby Ukraine.

Transnistria is a region that is not under the control of the Moldovan government. Visitors must show identification to cross into Transnistria. Those without a Moldovan government-issued identification document will have to show a passport. Visitors may also have to show ID such as a passport at checkpoints. This is at roads leading into and out of the region. Ukraine has closed its border crossing points into the Transnistrian region. Taking photographs of military facilities and security forces is not allowed and may result in trouble with authorities. 

The U.S. government's ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens traveling in Transnistria maybe be limited or delayed since Transnistria's de facto authorities control access to the region.
