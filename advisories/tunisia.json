Some areas have increased risk.

Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, museums, resorts, hotels, festivals, nightclubs, restaurants, religious sites, markets/shopping malls, government facilities and security forces. A country-wide state of emergency, which grants security forces more authority to maintain civil order and enables the government to focus on combating terrorism, is in effect.\n\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in some areas of Tunisia.\n\nRead the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tunisia.html) for additional information on travel to Tunisia.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Tunisia:\n\n  * Exercise caution when using public transportation, due to safety and security concerns.\n  * Avoid demonstrations and crowds.\n  * Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans.\n  * Avoid staying overnight outside of the main cities and tourist locations.\n  * Obtain comprehensive medical insurance that includes medical evacuation coverage valid for Tunisia.\n  * When entering or transiting through Tunisia, do not bring in Tunisian currency in any amount and avoid bringing in any foreign currency, including dollars, over TND 10,000 (about $3,000 USD).
