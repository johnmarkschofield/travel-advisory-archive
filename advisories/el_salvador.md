**_Updated due to change in travel advisory level to reflect changes in crime._**

**Country Summary:** Exercise normal precautions in El Salvador. Gang activity has decreased over the last three years. This has caused a drop in violent crimes and murders.

U.S. government employees working in El Salvador are allowed to travel throughout the country during daylight hours. However, due to the risks, U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling between cities or departments at night.

There are exceptions. U.S. government employees are allowed to travel at all hours between San Salvador and:

  * El Salvador's international airport.
  * La Libertad department.



U.S. government employees are prohibited from using public buses.

**State of Exception**

In March 2022, the Government of El Salvador declared a "State of Exception" in response to an increase in gang murders:

  * The State of Exception allows local authorities to arrest anyone they think is involved in gang activity.
  * It suspends several constitutional rights. This includes the normal protections of criminal procedure, like the right to a speedy or fair trial.
  * Tens of thousands of people are currently in prison under the State of Exception.
  * Several U.S. and other foreign citizens have been detained under the State of Exception. They remain in prison and have yet to face trial.



The State of Exception is still in place.
