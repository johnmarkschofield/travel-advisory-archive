**South Ossetia and Abkhazia - Level 4: Do Not Travel**

Russian troops and border guards occupy both South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions.  The precise locations of administrative boundary lines are difficult to identify.  Entering these areas could lead to arrest, imprisonment, or a fine. Violent attacks and criminal incidents occur in the region.  Landmines are a danger to travelers near the boundary lines of both territories.

Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Georgia are prohibited from traveling to South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  The U.S. government is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.  Do not travel to these areas for any reason.
