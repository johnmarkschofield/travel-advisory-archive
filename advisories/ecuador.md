**Advisory Summary** : 

**Crime and kidnapping**

Crime is a widespread problem in Ecuador. Violent crime typically associated with narcotrafficking is common. It includes murder, assault, kidnapping, and armed robbery.  Areas with transnational criminal organizations see much higher rates of violent crime. U.S. citizens and LPRs have been victims of kidnapping and extortion.

**Terrorism**

There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity in Ecuador. Visit the U.S. Department of State's country reports on terrorism to learn more. 

**Demonstrations**

  * Demonstrations**** happen across the country.
  * They are usually driven by political or economic reasons.
  * Demonstrators often block local roads and major highways without warning, disrupting access to important infrastructure.  



**Local and U.S. Government Assistance**

  * Most of Ecuador's land is empty and remote, especially outside big towns and cities.
  * Local and U.S. government help may be very limited in remote areas. This may cause delays for U.S. citizens in remote areas.



**Land Border Restrictions**

  * Foreign citizens entering the country by land from Colombia or Peru must show a certificate of no criminal record. This certificate must be apostilled. You can find more information on the [Ministry of Tourism's webpage](https://www.turismo.gob.ec/https-www-turismo-gob-ec-wp-content-uploads-2024-04-bp-sn-requisitos-de-ingreso-al-ecuador-por-fronteras-terrestres-02-04-2024-pdf/) and at [Ecuador.Travel](https://ecuador.travel/viaja-seguro/).
  * The U.S. Embassy and Consulate General in Ecuador cannot help you get the necessary documents for crossing a land border.
  * U.S. citizens planning to enter Ecuador via a land border should check the State Department's [Office of Authentications webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/records-and-authentications/authenticate-your-document/office-of-authentications.html) and [Criminal Records Check webpage](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/criminal-record-checks.html).
