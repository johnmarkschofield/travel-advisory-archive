**_There were no changes to the advisory level or risk indicators. Advisory summary was updated to reflect changes to U.S. embassy operations and hurricane damage._**

**Reconsider Travel** to **Jamaica** due to **Crime, Health,** and **Natural Disaster** risks. Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

**Advisory summary  
**The U.S. Embassy in Kingston has resumed normal operations following Hurricane Melissa. 

**Natural disaster  
**Hurricane Melissa made landfall in Jamaica on October 28, 2025, causing widespread damage. Some airports, including the Norman Manley International Airport in Kingston have reopened for commercial flights. Other airports were severely damaged and remain closed or offer only limited operations. U.S. citizens are advised to contact their transportation providers for confirmation of availability. The Black River community was heavily damaged, as well.

  * Consider rescheduling planned travel to Jamaica at this time. If you plan to travel, confirm availability with your transportation provider and at your destination before you leave.
  * Some areas, such as Black River and Montego Bay, are in varying stages of recovery from Hurricane Melissa. Until repairs are complete, fewer hotels and transportation options may be available.  Services may also be limited.

**Crime  
**Violent crime in Jamaica has decreased since 2024, but it remains statistically high throughout the country. The homicide rate reported by the Government of Jamaica is among the highest in the Western Hemisphere.

  * Tourist areas generally see lower rates of violent crime than other parts of the country.
  * Armed robberies and sexual assaults are common.
  * The U.S. Embassy routinely receives reports of sexual assaults, including from U.S. citizen tourists at resorts.
  * U.S. citizens report slow or unsatisfactory response to serious criminal incidents.
  * When arrests are made, cases are infrequently prosecuted to a final verdict and sentence.



**U.S. government employee travel restrictions  
**U.S. government employees working in Jamaica are not allowed to:

  * use public buses; or
  * drive between cities at night.



U.S. citizens in Jamaica are advised to take the same precautions.

**Health  
**Basic and specialized medical care may not be available in many parts of Jamaica. This includes slower emergency service response times and less availability of care for illness or injury.

  * Private hospitals require payment up front before admitting patients and may not have the ability to provide specialized care.
  * Ambulance services are not always staffed with EMTs and are not always readily available, especially in rural areas.
  * U.S. citizens should bring extra prescription medication as common medications, such as insulin, can be difficult to obtain.
  * U.S. Medicare/Medicaid does not apply overseas.
  * Most hospitals and doctors overseas do not accept U.S. health insurance.
  * Air ambulance service to the United States can range from $30,000-$50,000.
  * We highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel. Check with your travel insurance provider about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.
