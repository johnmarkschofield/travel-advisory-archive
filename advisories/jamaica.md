**Advisory Summary  
**

**U.S. government employee travel restrictions  
**U.S. government employees working in Jamaica are not allowed to use public buses or drive between cities at night. They are also not allowed to travel to certain high-risk areas, as noted below.

U.S. citizens in Jamaica should take the same precautions.

**Natural disaster**

Jamaica continues to recover from Hurricane Melissa, which made landfall there on October 28, 2025. The hurricane caused widespread damage to the western part of the island. Some areas are still experiencing post-storm impacts on infrastructure and services. 

  * All major airports have reopened for commercial flights.
  * Some areas in the western part of Jamaica, such as Black River and Montego Bay, are in varying stages of recovery from the hurricane. Exercise increased caution if traveling to affected areas at this time.
  * Confirm availability of services and amenities at your destination before you travel to Jamaica.



**Crime**

  * Violent crime is a risk throughout Jamaica. The homicide rate reported by the Government of Jamaica is among the highest in the Western Hemisphere.
  * Tourist areas generally see lower rates of violent crime than other parts of the country.
  * Armed robberies and sexual assaults are common.
  * The U.S. embassy routinely receives reports of sexual assaults, including from U.S. citizen tourists at resorts.
  * U.S. citizens report slow or unsatisfactory response to serious criminal incidents.
  * When arrests are made, cases are often not prosecuted to a final verdict and sentence.



**Health  
**Basic and specialized medical care may not be available in many parts of Jamaica. This includes slower emergency service response times and less availability of care for illness or injury.

  * Health care facilities in western Jamaica were badly damaged by Hurricane Melissa.
  * Private hospitals require payment up front before admitting patients. They may not be able to provide specialized care.
  * Ambulance services are not always staffed with EMTs. They are not always readily available, especially in rural areas.
  * U.S. citizens should bring extra prescription medication. Common medications, such as insulin, can be difficult to obtain.
  * U.S. Medicare and Medicaid do not apply abroad.
  * Most hospitals and doctors abroad do not accept U.S. health insurance.
  * Air ambulance service to the United States costs $30,000 on the low end.
  * We strongly recommend that you have travel insurance and confirm your coverage. Travel insurance should include medical insurance, evacuation assistance, and other trip coverage.
