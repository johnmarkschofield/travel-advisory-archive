Natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, or volcanic eruptions may result in disruptions to transportation, infrastructure, sanitation, and the availability of health services.

**Central Papua and Highland Papua - Level 4: Do Not Travel**

In Central Papua and Highland Papua, violent demonstrations and conflict could result in injury or death to U.S. citizens. Avoid demonstrations and crowds. Armed separatists may kidnap foreign nationals.

Due to the risks, the U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Central Papua and Highland Papua because U.S. government employees working in Indonesia must obtain special authorization before traveling to those areas.
