_**There were no changes to the advisory level. The "Crime" indicator was removed. The "Other" indicator was added. The advisory summary was updated.**_

Reconsider travel to Guinea-Bissau due to **unrest** , inadequate **health** infrastructure, and **landmines**.

**Advisory Summary  
**There is no U.S. embassy or consulate in Guinea-Bissau. The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens. Consular services are provided by the U.S. embassy in Dakar, Senegal.

**Unrest  
**Guinea-Bissau has had periods of political instability for decades, including political unrest in November 2025. Large-scale demonstrations related to the local political situation may occur with little notice. Demonstrations may disrupt transportation and other essential services.

**Health  
**Guinea-Bissau's health infrastructure is inadequate. Health services, hygiene, and quality control do not meet U.S. standards of care. Pharmacies are not well regulated. Locally available medications are limited and may be unsafe. Even a minor health issue may require medical evacuation at your own expense.

**Landmines  
**Landmines and unexploded ordnance from prior conflicts exist throughout Guinea-Bissau. Areas of greatest risk are Bafata, Oio, Biombo, Quinara, and Tombali. The locations of landmines and unexploded ordnance are often not known, marked, or easy to recognize.

**If you decide to travel to Guinea-Bissau:**

  * Review our information on [Travel to High-Risk Areas](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/travel-advisories/high-risk-areas.html).
  * Have a plan to leave in an emergency that does not depend on U.S. government help. Review our information on [Crisis and Evacuations](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/help-abroad/crisis-response.html).

  * Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.
  * Avoid demonstrations and crowds.
