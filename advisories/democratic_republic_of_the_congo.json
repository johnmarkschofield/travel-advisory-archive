This includes armed robbery, armed home invasion, and assault. Local police lack the resources to respond to serious crime in a timely and adequate manner. Assailants may pose as police or security agents. DRC law enforcement does not always inform the U.S. embassy when they arrest a U.S. citizen. They may also delay access to detained or charged U.S. citizens. DRC law enforcement has used violence and threats during interrogations.\n\nDemonstrations are common in many cities, and some have turned violent. Police may respond with force, resulting in deaths and arrests. Looting, assault, traffic obstruction, property damage, and other violent actions occur when police don't respond in a timely manner, or at all.\n\nThe U.S. government cannot provide emergency consular services to U.S. citizens outside of Kinshasa due to poor infrastructure and security risks. Due to the risks in the country, minor dependents cannot accompany U.S. government employees who work in the DRC.\n\nReview the country [information](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/DemocraticRepublicoftheCongoDRC.html) page for additional information on travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \n\nIf you decide to travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo:\n\n  * Visit our website for [Travel to High-Risk Areas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html).\n  * Avoid demonstrations and crowds.\n  * Use caution when walking or driving.\n  * Always have a photocopy of your U.S. passport and DRC visa.
