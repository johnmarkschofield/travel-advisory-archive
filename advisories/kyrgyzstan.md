**Border Region with Tajikistan - Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution**

Exercise increased caution to areas within approximately 30 kilometers of the border with Tajikistan.  The March 13, 2025, signing and subsequent ratifying of a bilateral agreement between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have facilitated the resumption of cross-border movement, but the situation remains fluid.  As of March 2025, two checkpoints on the border are open for transit.  There are no travel restrictions for Americans crossing the border.  However, visitors to the Batken region (especially the Batken and Leilek districts) should exercise caution and remain vigilant due to a recent history of border clashes.

U.S. government employees working in the Kyrgyz Republic are restricted from traveling to the Batken province without prior authorization from the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek.
