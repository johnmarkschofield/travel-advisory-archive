Exercise increased caution

in **The Gambia** due to **crime** , **unrest** , and **inadequate health infrastructure**. 

**Crime  
**Petty street crime and home burglaries happen often in The Gambia. This is most common in the Banjul area and tourist spots.

Do not display cash and valuable personal property. Avoid walking alone, including on beaches, in tourist areas, and after dark.

**Unrest  
**A separatist rebel group operates in the Casamance region of southern Senegal. There has been sporadic fighting along The Gambia’s southern border in the recent past. Stay on main roads and do not travel at night if travelling near or across the southern border.

**Health**  
The Gambia’s health infrastructure is inadequate. Health services, hygiene, and quality control do not meet U.S. standards of care. Pharmacies are not well regulated. Locally available medications may be unsafe.
