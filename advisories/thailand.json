There is a collateral risk of violence for U.S. citizens in Thailand's southernmost provinces due to low intensity conflict.\n\nThe U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these provinces as U.S government employees must obtain special authorization to travel to these provinces.\n\n**Level 4 - Do Not Travel  \nThailand - Cambodia Border:**\n\nDo not travel to areas within 50km of the Thai-Cambodian border due to **ongoing fighting** between Thai and Cambodian military forces.  \n  \nThere are reports of fighting, including rocket and artillery fire, between Cambodian and Thai forces along the border.  Armed conflict has led to civilian casualties, and the Thai government has ordered the evacuation of certain areas. There is a collateral risk of violence, and U.S. citizens are advised to avoid all but essential travel to within 50km of these border areas until further notice.  The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these provinces due to the ongoing risk of armed conflict.\n\nRead the [destination information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Thailand.html) for additional information on travel to Thailand.\n\n**If you decide to travel to Thailand:**\n\n  * Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance.\n  * Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://step.state.gov/step/) to get important updates and alerts from the U.S. embassy or consulate.
