Read the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Switzerland.html) for additional information on travel to Switzerland.

If you decide to travel to Switzerland:

  * Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://step.state.gov/step/) to receive messages and alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.
  * Review the [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Country/Switzerland/Content/Detail/Report/762a8fac-6467-4db1-a087-1cc8fe43592c) for Switzerland.
  * Prepare a plan for emergency situations. Review the [International Traveler's Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html).
  * Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travelers' Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/switzerland?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001) related to your travel and return to the United States.
  * We highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel. The [U.S. government does not provide insurance for U.S. citizens overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html). Check with your [travel insurance](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) provider about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.
