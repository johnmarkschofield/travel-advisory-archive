Exercise increased caution in Bosnia and Herzegovina due to **terrorism, crime,  **and**  land mines**.

**Country Summary:  **Terrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events, educational institutions, airports, and other public areas. Theft and other crimes of opportunity are common, especially against tourists. Violent crimes, such as robbery and murder, also occur due to the availability of firearms remaining from the war. Minefields and land mines are present throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina. While suspected hazardous areas are normally clearly marked, several people are killed or injured each year.
