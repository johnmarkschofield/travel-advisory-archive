Review the information on [how to apply for the special validation](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/requirements/passport-for-travel-to-north-korea.html).\n\n\n\n****Because the U.S. government does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, it cannot provide direct help to U.S. citizens in North Korea in emergencies.****\n\n  * Sweden serves as the U.S. protecting power in North Korea through its Embassy in Pyongyang and provides limited consular services to U.S. citizens. Additionally, the North Korean government has often delayed or denied Swedish officials access to U.S. citizens who are detained. \n  * The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) or a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). This is due to the risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of North Korea. \n  * For more information U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/north-korea-travel-advisory.html#ExternalPopup).\n\n\n"
