Exercise increased caution to Malawi due to **crime** and **unrest**.

**Advisory summary**

**Crime**

Violent crime such as theft, burglary, armed robbery, and assault is common. The capabilities of the Malawi Police Service are growing, but its resources and ability to deter and investigate crimes are limited. They also struggle to assist victims and apprehend criminals.

**Unrest**

Demonstrations may occur more often because of political issues and events like elections. Tear gas is often used at these protests, and roads might be blocked.
