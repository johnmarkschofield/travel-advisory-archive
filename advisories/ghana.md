**_Updated to reflect threats against women travelers and increased risks in specific regions._**

Exercise increased caution in Ghana due to **crime**  and **violence against women travelers and lesbian, gay, and bisexual travelers**.  Some areas of Ghana have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.

Reconsider Travel to:

  * The Upper East Region, North East Region, Upper West Region, and the western portion of the Savannah Region (all areas west of the N12 Highway) that shares a border with Burkina Faso and Cộte d'Ivoire due to **civil unrest** and **crime.**



**Country Summary:  **Violent crimes, such as carjacking, street mugging, assaults, and rape do occur.  These crimes often happen at night and in isolated locations.  Sexual assault, such as rape, is significantly underreported and remains a serious problem.  While domestic violence is criminal under Ghanian law, police rarely respond to reports of domestic violence.  

  * In urban areas and crowded markets
  * When traveling by private or public transportation after dark as criminal elements may use blockades to slow down and restrict movement of vehicles



Ghanaian law contains prohibitions on "unnatural carnal knowledge" - generally interpreted as any kind of sexual intimacy - between persons of the same sex, though in practice, the law is largely used to target men.  Punishments can include fines and/or incarceration of up to three years.  Rhetoric and violence targeting individuals on the basis of sexual orientation have increased in recent years.  Individuals have reported safety incidents that include targeted assault, rape, mob attacks, and harassment due to their sexual orientation.

**Areas Near the Northern Border in the Upper East Region, Upper West Region, and western area of the Savannah Region - Level 3:  Reconsider Travel**

U.S. citizens in Ghana should reconsider travel to the northern border areas near Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire due to **civil unrest and crime**.  Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Ghana must obtain special authorization to travel to the Upper West Region, the Upper East Region, the North East Region, and the western area of the Savannah Region.  The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in these areas.  Be sure to read the Burkina Faso Travel Advisory [here](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/burkina-faso-travel-advisory.html).

Local police may lack the resources to respond effectively to more serious crimes.
