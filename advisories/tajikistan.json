Some areas have increased risk. Read the entire Travel Advisory.\n\nReconsider travel to**:**\n\n  * Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan due to **terrorism**.\n  * Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO) due to the **potential for armed conflict**.\n\n\n\n**Country Summary:**  Terrorist organizations are known to have a presence in the region and have targeted foreigners and local authorities in the past.\n\n**Terrorists may attack** with little or no warning. They target:\n\n  * Tourist locations\n  * Transportation hubs\n  * Markets and shopping malls\n  * Restaurants\n  * Places of worship\n  * Schools\n  * Government facilities.\n\n\n\nVisit the U.S. Department of State [Country Reports on Terrorism](https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/) to learn more.\n\n**Unexploded landmines**  and cluster munitions are a hazard along the Afghan-Tajik and Uzbek-Tajik borders, as well as in the Vakhsh and Rasht valleys. Pay attention to land mine warning signs. Do not venture off the road into areas marked with red and white plastic tape. Avoid roadside ditches, shoulders, and unmarked trails in these regions. Never touch anything resembling unexploded munitions.\n\nBe cautious when traveling **near, along, and through the Tajikistan-Kyrgyz Republic land border** as there have been several instances of armed skirmishes between Tajik and Kyrgyz border guards over the past five years, particularly in the Isfara area and the Vorukh enclave. In March 2025, the March 13, 2025, signing and subsequent ratification of bilateral agreements between the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan have facilitated the resumption of cross-border movement at the Guliston-Kyzyl-Bel and Madaniyat-Kayragach border crossing points.\n\nTajikistan does not recognize dual nationality with the United States. Dual U.S.-Tajik citizens and U.S. citizens of Tajik descent may be subject to additional scrutiny and harassment from local authorities and may be denied access to U.S. consular officials while in detention.\n\nRead the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tajikistan.html) for additional information on travel to Tajikistan.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Tajikistan:\n\n  * Enter Tajikistan on your U.S. passport and keep it with you.\n  * Have a plan to depart Tajikistan which does not rely on U.S. government assistance.\n  * Keep a low profile.\n  * Be aware of your surroundings.\n  * Monitor local media for breaking events and be prepared to adjust your plans.\n  * Do not touch unknown metal objects and avoid traveling off well-used roads, tracks, and paths due to risk of unexploded ordnance.\n  * If you are arrested or detained, ask police or prison officials to notify the U.S. Embassy immediately.\n  * Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://mytravel.state.gov/s/step#_blank) to receive messages and Alerts from the U.S. Embassy and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n  * Review the [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/db7712a2-a425-4c86-b912-1c3888f61df8) for Tajikistan.\n  * Prepare a contingency plan for emergency situations. Review the [Traveler's Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-checklist.html).\n  * Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/tajikistan) related to your travel and return to the United States.\n  * We highly recommend that you buy insurance before you travel. Check with your [travel insurance provider](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/your-health-abroad/Insurance_Coverage_Overseas.html) about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancellation coverage.\n\n\n\n**_Border Areas with Afghanistan - Level 3: Reconsider Travel  \n_**Reconsider travel in proximity of Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan due to terrorism. The current political situation in Afghanistan creates a challenging and unpredictable security environment in the border areas. Travel in the mountainous region along the Afghan border can be dangerous due to the proximity of militant groups across the border. Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Tajikistan must obtain special authorization to travel to border areas with Afghanistan. U.S. citizens should remain alert and avoid activities that develop predictable patterns of movement. If documenting travel on social media, ensure your privacy settings do not reveal your exact location.\n\nVisit our website for [Travel to High-Risk Areas](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html).\n\n**_Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast (GBAO) - Level 3: Reconsider Travel  \n_**The challenging and unpredictable environment in northern Afghanistan has the potential to create insecurity in neighboring Tajikistan's GBAO region. GBAO is a restricted region for non-Tajik citizens, requiring travel permits from Tajik authorities. Violent clashes with security forces have erupted in GBAO in recent years, and the government of Tajikistan can suspend travel permits for non-Tajik citizens on short notice. Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in Tajikistan must obtain special authorization to travel to GBAO.\n\nVisit our website for information for [Travel to High-Risk Areas](https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/go/TraveltoHighRiskAreas.html) _._\n"
