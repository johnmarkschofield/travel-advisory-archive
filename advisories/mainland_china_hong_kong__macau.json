This takes at least five to seven days, significantly limiting the U.S. government's ability to offer timely consular services in the Macau SAR.\n\n**Dual nationality:  **The Macau SAR government does not recognize dual nationality. Dual U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional security and harassment. If you are a dual U.S.-PRC citizen awnd enter the Macau SAR on a U.S. passport, and you are detained or arrested, PRC authorities are under an obligation to notify the U.S. Embassy or a U.S. Consulate General of your detention and to allow U.S. consular officials to have access to you. In reality, however, U.S. consular officials may be prevented from providing consular assistance, even to those who have entered on their U.S. passports.
