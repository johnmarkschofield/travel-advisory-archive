Do not travel

to **Russia** for any reason due to **terrorism** , **unrest** , **wrongful detention** and **other risks**.

**U.S. citizens in Russia should leave immediately  
****The U.S. government has limited ability to help U.S. citizens in Russia, especially outside of Moscow. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has reduced its staff. The Russian government has also restricted travel for embassy personnel. All U.S. consulates in Russia have suspended operations, including consular services.  **

**Do not travel to Russia for any reason**  
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has limited ability to assist in the case of a detention of a U.S. citizen. There is no guarantee that the Russian government will grant the U.S. Embassy consular access to detained U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens may serve their entire prison sentence without  release. The risk of wrongful detention of U.S. citizens remains high. Even if a case is determined wrongful, there is no guarantee of release.

Russian officials often question and threaten U.S. citizens without reason. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens on false charges. They have denied them fair treatment and convicted them without credible evidence. Russian authorities have opened questionable investigations against U.S. citizens for their religious activities.

There have been drone attacks and explosions near the border with Ukraine, and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, and other large cities. In 2024, ISIS Khorasan claimed responsibility for the attack at Crocus Music Hall in Moscow. This attack killed 130 people. They also targeted places of worship in Dagestan. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter.

**Dual citizenship**  
Russia will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Russian citizen or have a claim to Russian citizenship.

  * Russia has blocked U.S. consular officers from visiting detained dual U.S.-Russian citizens.
  * The Russian government has forced dual citizens to join the military. They also have stopped them from leaving the country.
  * In 2022, Russia started drafting citizens for the war in Ukraine. The military draft is ongoing.
  * Failure to adhere to Russian laws and regulations on dual citizenship can result in arrest.



**Demonstrations**  
In Russia, peaceful assembly and freedom of speech are not protected rights. U.S. citizens should avoid protests and taking photos of security staff at these events. Russian authorities have arrested U.S. citizens who have joined protests. Russians and U.S. citizens have been detained for posts on social media.

**Electronic devices**  
Reconsider bringing electronic devices into Russia. U.S. citizens should assume all electronic communications and devices in Russia are monitored by Russian security services. Russian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices. This includes information that was created, transmitted, or stored while in another country.

**Debit and credit cards**  
U.S. credit and debit cards no longer work in Russia. Due to sanctions, sending electronic money transfers from the United States to Russia is nearly impossible.  The U.S. Embassy cannot assist with transferring money to circumvent sanctions. 

**Air travel  
** There are few commercial air travel options available. It may not be easy to book flights on short notice. If you wish to leave Russia, you should make your own travel plans. The U.S. Embassy can only offer limited help to U.S. citizens trying to leave. Transportation options could become even more limited at any time.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has downgraded Russia's air safety rating from [Category 1 to Category 2 due to safety concerns](https://www.faa.gov/travelers/international_travel). U.S. government personnel are generally not allowed to fly on Russian airlines due to safety concerns.

Additionally, the FAA banned U.S. flights within certain areas of Russian airspace, by issuing a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or in the vicinity of these certain areas. For more information U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions#RussianFederation).

**Laws and special circumstances**  
Russian officials have questioned, threatened, and detained U.S. citizens without reason. This includes both former and current U.S. government and military personnel, as well as private U.S. citizens. Russian authorities have a history of wrongfully detaining U.S. nationals and using them as bargaining chips.

  * U.S. citizens may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion.
  * Russian authorities do not always notify the U.S. embassy about the detention of a U.S. citizen. They may delay or deny U.S. consular help.
  * Russian security services target foreign nationals and international organizations considered “undesirable.”
  * Russian law allows authorities to punish foreigners for treason. This includes working for organizations that Russia perceives as acting against Russian interests. Former and current U.S. government employees and contractors should pay special attention to this part of Russian law.



**Security**  
Drone attacks and explosions have taken place near the border with Ukraine and in Moscow, Kazan, St. Petersburg, and other large cities. In an emergency, you should follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter.

Russia's war in Ukraine has destabilized security in southwestern Russia. In October 2022, the Russian government declared martial law in the following border areas with Ukraine: Bryansk, Kursk, Belgorod, Voronezh, Rostov, and Krasnodar.

Under martial law, authorities can:

  * Set curfews
  * Seize property
  * Restrict movement
  * Detain foreigners
  * Forcibly relocate residents
  * Limit public gatherings



Russian authorities have questioned, detained, and arrested people for “acting against Russia's interests.” Local authorities have targeted people for posting on social media or supporting "anti-Russian" groups. They have punished people for criticizing the government or military.

**Gay and lesbian travelers**  
The Russian government's  "propaganda" law bans discussion of gay and lesbian topics. The community has been labeled as “extremist,” and it is considered a crime to support the human rights of gay and lesbian people in Russia. Displaying certain symbols, including the rainbow flag, is a crime.  Foreigners found guilty of violating this law may be arrested and detained for up to 15 days and then deported.

**Terrorism**  
Terrorists continue to plan and carry out attacks in Russia. The March 2024 Crocus City Hall attack in Moscow proved terrorists can strike without warning.

U.S. government employees working in Russia are prohibited from traveling to the North Caucasus, including Chechnya and Mt. Elbrus.

**Russian annexation of territories  
** The international community does not recognize Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya.

Russia staged its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, in part, from occupied Crimea. There is a heavy Russian military presence in these areas and intense fighting across these regions.

Russian authorities have abused foreigners and locals. In particular, they have targeted people who they see as opposing Russia’s authority.

The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv, Ukraine offers consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea, Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya. However, the ongoing war limits the embassy's ability to help U.S. citizens in these areas.
