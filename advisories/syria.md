Do not travel

to **Syria** for any reason due to the risk of **terrorism** , **unrest** , **kidnapping** , **hostage taking, crime** , and **armed conflict.**

Do not travel to Syria for any reason.

The U.S. government suspended U.S. Embassy operations in 2012. The Czech Republic is the protecting power for the United States in Syria. The U.S. government cannot offer emergency or routine consular services to U.S. citizens in Syria due to the safety risks. 

Armed conflict  
Syria has experienced active armed conflict since 2011. No part of Syria is safe from violence. Hostage taking, terrorism, unexploded ordnance, and aerial bombardment pose significant risk of death or serious injury. The destruction of infrastructure, housing, medical facilities, schools, and power and water utilities has also increased hardships in Syria.

The U.S. government strongly warns private U.S. citizens against traveling to Syria to engage in armed conflict. The U.S. government does not support this activity. U.S. citizens who undertake such activity face extreme personal risks, including being taken hostage, injury, or death.

Terrorism  
There is risk of terrorist violence in Syria. Visit the U.S. Department of State’s [country reports on terrorism](https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/) to learn more. 

  * Bombings, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and assassinations remain a threat in parts of Syria. 
  * Providing material support or resources to designated foreign terrorist organizations, including ISIS and al-Qa’ida (AQ) affiliates, is a **crime under U.S. law** that can result in prison time and large fines.



Hostage taking  


  * Hostage taking of U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals continues to be a risk throughout the country.  



Air travel  
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) and a Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR). This is due to risks to civil aviation operating within or nearby Syria. 

  * For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration’s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions). 
  * Review our Travel Guidance for additional information on Syria, including alerts related to the closure of airspace.



Maritime travel

  * The U.S. Coast Guard determined Syrian ports do not have effective anti-terrorism measures. Vessels that arrive in U.S. ports from Syrian ports must meet additional U.S. Coast Guard conditions of entry as described in the current Port Security Advisory, International Port Security Program - Port Security Advisory. 
  * Mariners and passengers traveling through Syrian ports should be careful and use strong security measures.  



Czech Protecting Power in Damascus  
The U.S. government suspended U.S. Embassy operations in 2012. The Czech Republic serves as the protecting power for the United States in Syria. 

The Czech Protecting Power provides only emergency services to U.S. citizens, including:

  * Acceptance of applications for emergency passports
  * Consular Report of Death Abroad (CRODA) applications
  * Emergency financial assistance
  * Assistance to detained U.S. nationals
  * Welfare and whereabouts checks for U.S. citizens when security conditions permit 



For routine consular services, including applying for a full-validity U.S. passport or Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA), and notarial services, U.S. citizens must visit a U.S. embassy or consulate outside Syria or return to the United States.
