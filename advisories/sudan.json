Advisory summary was updated.**\n\n**Advisory summary  \n**The U.S. Embassy in Khartoum suspended its operations in April 2023 due to the outbreak of armed conflict in Sudan. The U.S. government cannot provide routine or emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Sudan due to the current security situation.\n\nTo report an emergency regarding a U.S. citizen in Sudan, contact U.S. Embassy Cairo at +20-2-2797-3300. Or contact the Department of State at +1-888-407-4747 from the United States and Canada or +1-202-501-4444 from elsewhere in the world.\n\n**Unrest - Armed Conflict  \n**Armed conflict continues in Sudan. This includes heavy fighting among the Sudanese Armed Forces, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, and various armed militias. The situation is violent, volatile, and extremely unpredictable, particularly in the Kordofan and Darfur regions, as well as in the capital region, including Khartoum and Omdurman.\n\nKhartoum International Airport is currently closed to commercial traffic, while commercial service to the Port Sudan International Airport has been limited at times due to drone strikes. Electrical and communication disruptions can occur at any time. This includes internet and cell phone service interruptions.\n\n**Crime  \n**Crime, including kidnapping, assault, armed robbery, home invasion, looting, and carjacking, is a common threat throughout the country. Checkpoints might occur at any time, some of which may be legitimate security checkpoints, others may intend to loot, others may present a risk to particular populations.\n\n**Terrorism  \n**Members of known terrorist groups and individuals sympathetic to these groups can attack with little or no warning. They may target foreign and local government facilities as well as areas frequented by travelers.\n\n**Landmines  \n**Landmines are a threat, as much of Sudan is an active war zone. There are widespread reports of unexploded ordnance posing a threat in Khartoum and elsewhere in the country, even after fighting has ended in those areas.\n\n**Health  \n**Medical services in Sudan are extremely limited. Adequate medical treatment for routine and emergency procedures is often not available. Even minor health issues could require medical evacuation at the traveler's expense. Make sure you have medical or travel insurance that includes medical evacuation. Review our information on [Travel Insurance](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/planning/guidance/insurance.html). Check with your doctor about required vaccines and shots for high-risk exposure before you go to Sudan. Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for the latest [Travel Health Information for Sudan](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/sudan?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001).\n\n**For U.S. citizens in Sudan** :\n\n  * The Department of State urges U.S. citizens to leave Sudan.\n  * Travel within Sudan is conducted at your own risk. The U.S. government cannot guarantee your safety traveling to airports, borders, or during any onward travel. You should consider your personal security situation before traveling anywhere in Sudan. Only attempt to depart Sudan**** or travel within Sudan**** if you believe it is safe for you to do so.  \n  * Exercise extreme caution in all parts of the country, including Khartoum.\n  * Have a plan to leave in an emergency that does not depend on U.S. government help. Review our information on [crisis and evacuations](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/help-abroad/crisis-response.html).\n  * Review our information on [crime](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/travel-advisories/crime.html), including for [victims of crime](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/help-abroad/victims-crime.html).\n  * There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity, in Sudan. Visit the U.S. Department of State's [Country Reports on Terrorism](https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/#crt) to learn more.\n  * Review our information on [terrorism](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/travel-advisories/global-events/terrorism.html) and [travel to high-risk areas](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/travel-advisories/high-risk-areas.html).\n  * Landmines and unexploded ordnance exist throughout Sudan. The locations of landmines and unexploded ordnance are often not known, marked, or easy to recognize.\n  * Monitor local media for breaking news. Be prepared to adjust your plans.\n  * Stay aware of your surroundings.\n  * Draft a will. Designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries or draft a power of attorney.\n  * Develop a communication plan with your family, your employer, or your host organization. List how and when you will confirm you are safe (text or call). Specify how often you will do this.\n  * Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones. If you are taken hostage, your loved ones will know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to confirm you are being held captive and alive.\n  * Make sure your insurance includes specific coverage for medical evacuation from Sudan.\n  * Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://mytravel.state.gov/s/step) to get important updates and alerts from the U.S. government. Enrolling helps the U.S. government contact you or your emergency contact in an emergency.\n  * Review the [Country Security Report for Sudan](https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/a835186b-730a-4bd6-a39f-1c5d651706d3).\n  * Visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for the latest [Travel Health Information for Sudan](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/sudan?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001).\n  * We highly recommend that you buy travel insurance before you travel. Check with your [travel insurance provider](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/planning/guidance/insurance.html) about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancelation coverage.\n\n\n"
