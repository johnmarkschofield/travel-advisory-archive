_There was no change to the advisory level. The "Health" risk indicator was added. Advisory summary was updated._

 

Do not travel to the Central African Republic due to risk of **unrest,** **crime, kidnapping, landmines, health,** and **terrorism.**

**Advisory summary**

The U.S. government has limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the Central African Republic.

  * U.S. government employees working in the Central African Republic must get special authorization to travel outside of Bangui. They are required to travel in armored vehicles in Bangui and are subject to a curfew.
  * Family members cannot join U.S. government employees who work in the Central African Republic.



**Unrest**

There is a continuing risk of civil unrest, demonstrations, and election-related violence. This includes renewed outbreaks of armed conflict occurring throughout the country.

  * Unrest can happen in the capital of Bangui.
  * Armed groups and opposition forces control large areas of the country. They regularly kidnap, injure, or kill civilians.
  * Airport, land border crossings, and road closures may occur without warning.



**Crime**

Violent crime is common. It includes homicide, kidnapping, armed robbery, aggravated battery, and larceny.

**Kidnapping**

Criminal gangs and armed groups kidnap for ransom on a frequent basis, mainly outside of Bangui. Local law enforcement officials are not equipped or trained to handle the threat of kidnapping.

**Other - Landmines**

Unexploded landmines are unmarked. They are a known risk. Landmines may be present anywhere outside Bangui, particularly:

  * Along the border with Cameroon
  * In the tri-border region with Chad in Sector West
  * Near Bambari in Sector East



**Health**

Medical services in the Central African Republic are extremely limited. There is no adequate medical treatment available for routine and emergency procedures. Even minor health issues could require medical evacuation at your expense.

  * Make sure you know if your health insurance plan covers any medical expenses coverage abroad. Most U.S. plans do not. 
  * If you purchase medical travel insurance, you are responsible for seeking reimbursement from your medical insurance. Be sure to follow their guidance and instructions for filing claims. 
  * We strongly recommend [supplemental insurance](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/planning/guidance/insurance.html) to cover medical evacuation. 



**Vaccinations**

Make sure you are up to date on all routine vaccines before every trip.  Travelers are required to show proof of yellow fever vaccination for all arriving travelers (at least 9 months old). CDC recommends that travelers going to the Central African Republic take prescription medicine to prevent malaria.

Stay up to date with the vaccines recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:

**Terrorism**

Ineffective border controls may allow criminal and terrorist groups to seek temporary refuge in the Central African Republic. Be alert to your surroundings. Terrorists can attack without warning. They may target foreign and local government facilities as well as tourist areas.
