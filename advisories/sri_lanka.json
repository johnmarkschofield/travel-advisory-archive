Most land mines have been cleared, but some areas in northern and eastern Sri Lanka are still dangerous. The highest concentration is in the northern districts of the Northern Province. This territory has dense forests and rough terrain. Warning signs with the international land mine symbol mark the areas of greatest risk. The symbol shows a skull and crossbones in a red, upside-down triangle. White markers indicate cleared land. \n"
