Reconsider travel due to a **limited ability to provide emergency consular services.** Exercise increased caution due to the **arbitrary enforcement of local laws.**

**Summary:** The U.S. government has a limited ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in the Macau SAR due to People's Republic of China (PRC) Ministry of Foreign Affairs travel restrictions on U.S. diplomatic personnel.

Even in an emergency, the PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs requires all U.S. diplomatic personnel, including those accredited to the Macau SAR, to apply for and receive visas before entering the Macau SAR. This takes at least five to seven days, significantly limiting the U.S. government's ability to offer timely consular services in the Macau SAR.

**Dual nationality:** The Macau SAR government does not recognize dual nationality. Dual U.S.-PRC citizens and U.S. citizens of Chinese descent may be subject to additional security and harassment. If you are a dual U.S.-PRC citizen awnd enter the Macau SAR on a U.S. passport, and you are detained or arrested, PRC authorities are under an obligation to notify the U.S. Embassy or a U.S. Consulate General of your detention and to allow U.S. consular officials to have access to you. In reality, however, U.S. consular officials may be prevented from providing consular assistance, even to those who have entered on their U.S. passports.

**Demonstrations:** Participating in demonstrations or any other activities that authorities interpret as constituting an act of secession, subversion, terrorism, or collusion with a foreign country could result in criminal charges. Be aware of your surroundings and avoid demonstrations.
