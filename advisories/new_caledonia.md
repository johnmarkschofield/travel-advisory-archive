**_Updated to reflect change to Travel Advisory Level 3._**

Reconsider travel to New Caledonia due to **civil unrest and crime**.

U.S. citizens should reconsider travel to New Caledonia or consider departing by commercial or other privately available transportation options, in light of the current security situation and infrastructure challenges following riots related to electoral reform in May 2024. The French Government has taken and/or could take additional measures, including declaring a state of emergency, curfews, restrictions on freedom of movement, ID verification, and increased security inspections. Follow any state of emergency measures imposed in your province.

Protests, demonstrations, tire burning, and roadblocks are frequent, unpredictable, and have turned violent. During civil unrest, commercial transportation may become unavailable without warning for U.S. citizens wishing to depart New Caledonia. The U.S. government is extremely limited in its ability to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in New Caledonia - assistance on site is available only from local authorities.
