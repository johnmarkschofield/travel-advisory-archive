For more information U.S. citizens should consult the [Federal Aviation Administration's Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/).\n\n**Terrorism Summary:** Residents and visitors generally find Oman to be safe, and protests have been rare, peaceful, and closely monitored by the government. However, threats - including terrorism - remain possible. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, and targets may include tourist locations, transportation hubs, places of worship, markets, shopping malls, or any place where large crowds gather. The Embassy advises U.S. citizens to avoid protests and to always remain vigilant. \n\nRead the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Oman.html) for additional information on travel to Oman.\n\nIf you decide to travel to Oman:\n\n  * Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program](https://step.state.gov/step/) ([STEP](https://step.state.gov/step/)) to receive Alerts and make it easier to locate you in an emergency.\n  * Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible. \n  * Follow the Department of State on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/travelgov/) and [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/TravelGov).\n  * Review the [Country Security Report](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.osac.gov%2FContent%2FBrowse%2FReport%3FsubContentTypes%3DCountry%2520Security%2520Report&data=04%7C01%7CGatesDN%40state.gov%7Ce5b9981ae5a74576c4a508da0695e01f%7C66cf50745afe48d1a691a12b2121f44b%7C0%7C0%7C637829538016617374%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000&sdata=%2BjeekQvgUygW7iLkkt8eZiPkdP20FTgfwg8n96lPdw8%3D&reserved=0) for Oman.\n  * Visit the CDC page for the latest [Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/list) related to your travel.\n  * U.S. citizens who travel abroad should always have a contingency plan for emergency situations.
