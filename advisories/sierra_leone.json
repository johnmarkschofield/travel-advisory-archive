  "content_md": "Exercise increased caution in Sierra Leone due to **crime** , **civil unrest** , and inadequate **health** infrastructure.\n\n**Advisory Summary:  **\n\n**Crime  \n**Violent crimes, such as robbery and assault, occur frequently in Sierra Leone, especially in Freetown. Police struggle to respond to serious crime in most places due to limited resources.\n\nDo not travel outside the Freetown peninsula after nightfall. There are increased safety hazards and security concerns at night. U.S. government employees in Sierra Leone are prohibited from travel outside the capital after dark. The U.S. Embassy in Freetown cannot offer emergency services outside Freetown at night.\n\nReview our information on [Crime Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/travel-advisories/crime.html) and for [Victims of Crime](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/help-abroad/victims-crime.html).\n\n**Unrest  \n**Demonstrations and protests** ** occur in Sierra Leone and occasionally result in violence. Protests can happen with little to no warning. They often develop around political issues, large events, or holidays.\n\n**Health  \n**Sierra Leone's health infrastructure is inadequate. Health facilities, services, hygiene, and quality control do not meet U.S. standards of care. Pharmacies are not well regulated. Locally available medications may be unsafe.\n\nMake sure you have medical or travel insurance that includes medical evacuation. Be sure to bring enough prescription medications to last the entire duration of your trip. Review our information on [Travel Insurance](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/planning/guidance/insurance.html).\n\n**If you decide to travel to Sierra Leone:**\n\n  * Avoid demonstrations and crowds.\n  * Stay aware of your surroundings.\n  * Do not display signs of wealth, such as expensive watches, jewelry, or smartphones.\n  * Use caution when walking or driving at night.\n  * Do not physically resist any robbery attempt.\n  * Be extra vigilant when visiting banks or ATMs.\n  * Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.\n  * Check with your doctor about required vaccines and shots for high-risk exposure before you go to Sierra Leone. Review the Health section in the Travel Guidance for Sierra Leone.\n  * Enroll in the [Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)](https://mytravel.state.gov/s/step) to get important updates and alerts from the U.S. embassy or consulate. Enrolling helps the U.S. embassy or consulate contact you or your emergency contact in an emergency.\n  * Review the [Country Security Report](https://www.osac.gov/Country/SierraLeone/Detail) for Sierra Leone.\n  * Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for the [latest Travel Health Information](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/sierra-leone) for Sierra Leone.\n  * Whether you're a first time or frequent traveler, use the [International Travel Checklist](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/planning/checklist.html).\n  * We highly recommend that you buy travel insurance before you travel. Check with your [travel insurance provider](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/planning/guidance/insurance.html) about evacuation assistance, medical insurance, and trip cancelation coverage.\n\n\n"
