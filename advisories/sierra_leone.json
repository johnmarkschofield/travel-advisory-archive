  "content_md": "Exercise increased caution\n\nin **Sierra Leone** due to **crime** , **unrest** , and **inadequate health infrastructure**. \n\nCrime\n\n  * Violent crimes, such as robbery and assault, occur frequently in Sierra Leone, especially in Freetown. Police struggle to respond to serious crime in most places due to limited resources.\n  * Do not travel outside the Freetown peninsula after nightfall. There are increased safety hazards and security concerns at night. U.S. government employees in Sierra Leone are prohibited from travel outside the capital after dark. The U.S. Embassy in Freetown cannot offer emergency services outside Freetown at night.\n  * Review our information on [Crime Abroad](/en/international-travel/travel-advisories/crime.html) and for [Victims of Crime](/en/international-travel/help-abroad/victims-crime.html).\n\n\n\nUnrest\n\n  * Demonstrations and protests occur in Sierra Leone and occasionally result in violence. Protests can happen with little to no warning. They often develop around political issues, large events, or holidays.\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n  * Sierra Leone\u2019s health infrastructure is inadequate. Health facilities, services, hygiene, and quality control do not meet U.S. standards of care. Pharmacies are not well regulated. Locally available medications may be unsafe.\n  * Make sure you have medical or travel insurance that includes medical evacuation. Be sure to bring enough prescription medications to last the entire duration of your trip.
