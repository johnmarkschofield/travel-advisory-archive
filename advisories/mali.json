This helps them monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas. Specify how you'll confirm you're safe (text, calls, etc.), how often, and who you'll contact first to share the information.\n  * Identify key sources of possible help for you and your family in case of emergency, such as the local U.S. embassy or consulate, FBI, the State Department, your employer (if traveling on business), and local friends or family in the high-risk area. \n  * Choose one family member to serve as the point of contact. If you are kidnapped or taken hostage, that person can communicate with kidnappers or hostage-takers, media, U.S. or foreign government agencies, and members of Congress.\n  * Establish a proof of life protocol with your loved ones. If you are taken hostage, your loved ones will know specific questions (and answers) to ask the hostage-takers to confirm that you are being held captive and alive.\n  * Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them for identification purposes.\n  * Use all available safety measures in your home or hotel, always including locking doors and windows, and setting the alarm.\n  * If asked to stop by police, stop only in well-lit areas or places where several officers are posted.\n  * Before you travel, delete any sensitive photos, comments, or content that might be seen as controversial or inappropriate in your destination.
