  "content_md": "_**Reissued with updates after periodic review.**_\n\n**Do not travel to Ukraine due to Russia 's war against Ukraine. **The Department of State continues to advise U.S. citizens to not travel to frontline regions of Ukraine and areas along Ukraine's border with Belarus due to presence of Russian and Belarusian military and security forces on the Belarusian side of the border, proximity to active ground combat, frequent shelling, missile and drone attacks on populated areas and civilian infrastructure, and limitations on the Embassy's ability to provide assistance to U.S. citizens in those areas. Read the entire Travel Advisory.****\n\n**Some regions may have lower level of risk due to air defense capabilities and distance from active combat zones.**\n\n**Level 3: Reconsider Travel to the regions of Volyn, Lviv, Zakarpattia, Ivano-Frankivsk, Chernivtsi, Ternopil, Rivne, Khmelnytskyi and Zhytomyr.  \n**Russia's unprovoked full-scale invasion of Ukraine continues, and even non-frontline regions remain subject to Russian missile and drone attacks. Travelers should react to air alerts and seek appropriate shelter. The security situation can change quickly, and travelers should be prepared to depart immediately with little to no warning. Closed airspace restricts travel options, and non-frontline regions are still subject to martial law restrictions, such as a nationwide curfew. U.S. government employees are subject to movement, curfew, and activity restrictions that may be more limited than Ukrainian government restrictions under martial law.****\n\nAll U.S. citizens should carefully monitor U.S. government notices and local and international media outlets for information about changing security conditions and alerts to shelter in place. The security situation in Ukraine remains unpredictable.\n\nU.S. citizens in Ukraine should stay vigilant and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness in the event of military attacks. Download and turn on notifications for free mobile applications - which U.S. government personnel in Ukraine are required to have and monitor - that announce air alerts in real time, such as [Air Raid Siren](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%96%D1%82%D1%80%D1%8F%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0/id1611955391) and [Alarm Map](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%82%D0%B0-%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B3/id1617641432). The U.S. Embassy does not have the ability to provide real-time alerts to the general U.S. citizen community of air threats. Know the location of your closest shelter at all times. In the event of mortar, missile, drone, or rocket fire, follow instructions from local authorities and seek shelter immediately. If you feel your current location is no longer safe, you should carefully assess the potential risks involved in moving to a different location.\n\nOn February 24, 2022, the Ukrainian government declared a state of emergency. Each region (oblast) decides on measures to be implemented according to local conditions. Measures could include curfews, restrictions on the freedom of movement, ID verification, and increased security inspections, among other measures. Follow any oblast-specific state of emergency measures.\n\nUkrainian law does not recognize dual nationality, and Ukraine will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are also a citizen of Ukraine. Dual citizens will be treated as Ukrainian citizens while in Ukraine and will be required to use a Ukrainian passport upon entry and exit of the country. Men aged 18-60 with Ukrainian citizenship are also subject to exit restrictions and possible mobilization during the period of martial law. The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv has received numerous reports of dual U.S.-Ukrainian citizens encountering significant difficulties both entering and exiting Ukraine. Travelers with family ties to Ukraine should consult the nearest Ukrainian Embassy or Consulate regarding potential citizenship obligations before entering Ukraine. For more information on traveling with dual nationality, please visit our [Travelers with Dual Nationality](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/Dual-Nationality-Travelers.html) page.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) prohibiting U.S. aviation operations into, out of, within, or over Ukraine. For more information, U.S. citizens should consult the FAA's [Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/ukraine-travel-advisory.html#ExternalPopup).\n\nU.S. citizens seeking assistance, including routine services, should email [KyivACS@state.gov](mailto:KyivACS@state.gov). Please review [what the U.S. government can and cannot do to assist you in a crisis overseas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/emergencies/what-state-dept-can-cant-do-crisis.html).\n\n**The Embassy is open and operating in Kyiv; however, Embassy personnel are subject to movement, curfew, and activity restrictions, which may cause delays in provision of consular assistance to U.S. citizens outside of Kyiv.**\n\n**Occupied Territories:**  \nMost of the international community, including the United States and Ukraine, do not recognize Russia's purported annexation of Crimea in 2014, nor the September 2022 purported annexation of four other Ukrainian oblasts -- Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia. There is extensive Russian Federation military presence in many parts of these oblasts. There are also abuses against foreigners and the local population by the occupation authorities in these regions, particularly against those who are seen as challenging Russia's occupation.\n\nThere are instances of Russian forces and their proxies singling out U.S. citizens in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine for detention, interrogation, or harassment because of their nationality. U.S. citizens have also been singled out when evacuating by land through Russia-occupied territory or to Russia or Belarus.\n\nAlthough Russia's occupation severely restricts the Embassy's access and ability to provide services in these areas, the Department of State and the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv continue to remotely provide certain emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in Crimea as well as four other Ukrainian oblasts partially occupied by Russia - Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson, and Zaporizhzhia.\n\nRead the [country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Ukraine.html) for additional information on travel to Ukraine.\n\n**Travel to High-Risk Areas:**  \nIf you choose to travel to Ukraine, you should consider taking the following steps:\n\n  * Visit our website on [Travel to High-Risk areas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/before-you-go/travelers-with-special-considerations/high-risk-travelers.html).\n  * Draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and/or power of attorney.\n  * Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care/custody of children, pets, property, belongings, non-liquid assets (collections, artwork, etc.), funeral wishes, etc.\n  * Share important documents, login information, and points of contact with loved ones so that they can manage your affairs if you are unable to return as planned to the United States.\n  * Leave DNA samples with your medical provider in case it is necessary for your family to access them.\n  * Establish your own personal security plan in coordination with your employer or host organization or consider consulting with a professional security organization.\n  * Develop a communication plan with family and/or your employer or host organization so that they can monitor your safety and location as you travel through high-risk areas.
