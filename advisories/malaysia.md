**Malaysia is generally a safe destination for travelers.

**Level 2 - Exercise Increased Caution -  Islands and Maritime Areas Off the Coast of Sabah State**

Exercise increased caution on islands and maritime areas off the coast of Eastern Sabah from Kudat in the north to Tawau in the south due to risk of **kidnapping**.

Kidnappings-for-ransom have occurred in this area, targeting island resorts and maritime activities. U.S. government employees working in Malaysia __ need special authorization to travel to this area, and due to its remote location, the U.S. government has limited ability to offer emergency services.  

**If you decide to travel to islands and maritime areas between Kudat and Tawau in eastern Sabah State:**

  * Review our information on [U.S. Citizens Missing Abroad](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/help-abroad/missing-us-citizen.html) and for [Victims of Crime](https://travel.state.gov/en/international-travel/help-abroad/victims-crime.html).
