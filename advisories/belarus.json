  "content_md": "Do not travel\n\nto **Belarus** for any reason due to **unrest** and**other risks**.\n\nThe U.S. government has extremely limited ability to help detained U.S. citizens. You may not receive consular access. You could also face arbitrary detention with no contact with the outside world.\n\n**Ordered departure**  \nOn February 28, 2022, the U.S. Department of State ordered the departure of U.S. government employees. It also suspended operations at U.S. Embassy Minsk.\n\n**There are no consular services, routine or emergency, until further notice.** The U.S. government has severely limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in Belarus. U.S. citizens in Belarus who require consular services should leave the country immediately. Please contact a U.S. embassy or consulate in another country.\n\n#### Dual citizenship  \nBelarus does not recognize dual nationality. Belarus will not recognize your U.S. citizenship if you are a dual U.S.-Belarusian citizen or have a claim to Belarusian citizenship. \n\n  * Belarus repeatedly has blocked U.S. consular officers from visiting detained dual U.S.-Belarusian citizens. \n  * The Belarusian government has prevented dual U.S.-Belarusian citizens from departing the country. In some cases, it has forced dual citizens into mandatory military service.\n\n\n\n#### Demonstrations  \nIn Belarus, freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly are not protected rights.\n\n  * U.S. citizens should avoid demonstrations. \n  * Belarusian authorities have used excessive force to disperse demonstrators, including people peacefully demonstrating. Bystanders, including foreign nationals, face the possibility of arbitrary arrest or detention.\n  * U.S. citizens near demonstrations have been arrested. Some have been victims of harassment or mistreatment by Belarusian officials. \n  * Belarusian officials unevenly enforce laws and regulations. Belarusian authorities have targeted people linked to independent and foreign media. \n  * Belarusian authorities have detained tens of thousands of people, including many imprisoned for political activities that may not be considered crimes in the United States. This includes U.S. citizens tied to opposition parties or political protests, even if they happened outside Belarus. \n\n\n\nDetention conditions  \nBelarusian detention facilities are extremely poor. There are credible reports that authorities mistreat and abuse prisoners while in custody.\n\n  * The Belarusian authorities have denied prisoners access to their embassy and lawyers. They have restricted communication with family outside prison.\n\n\n\nElectronic devices  \nReconsider bringing electronic devices into Belarus.\n\nU.S. citizens should assume all electronic communications and devices in Belarus are monitored.\n\n  * Belarusian security services have arrested U.S. citizens and other foreign nationals based on information found on electronic devices. This includes data created, sent, or stored while in another country.\n\n\n\nAir travel  \nThere are few commercial air travel options available to and from Belarus.\n\n  * Flights could be unavailable on short notice. The availability of other transportation options could change at any time.\n  * Those wishing to leave Belarus should make their own travel plans. The U.S. government cannot help U.S. citizens trying to leave. \n  * Border crossings with neighboring states sometimes close with little notice. U.S. citizens should regularly reevaluate departure plans in the event of an emergency. \n\n\n\nOn May 23, 2021, Belarusian authorities made a commercial plane land improperly. They did this to arrest an opposition journalist on board. EU airlines now avoid Belarusian airspace.\n\nOn February 24, 2022, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an ongoing Advisory Notice to Airmen (NOTAM). It bans U.S. air carriers and commercial operators, U.S. pilots, and U.S. registered aircraft from operating in the Minsk Flight Information Region (UMMV). This is due to safety-of-flight risks from ongoing hostilities in Belarus.\n\nThe [Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Prohibitions, Restrictions and Notices includes more information](https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions).\n"
