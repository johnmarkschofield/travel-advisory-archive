Exercise increased caution

in **South Africa** due to **crime, terrorism, unrest,** and **kidnapping.**

  * Violent crime is common and includes robbery, rape, carjacking and mugging. There are also "smash-and-grab" attacks on vehicles. 
    * Violent crime is more common in the downtown areas of big cities, especially after dark. 
    * Kidnapping is a threat in South Africa. Kidnappers target U.S. citizens and other foreign travelers to steal money. 
    * Captors often force victims to withdraw cash or give online account passwords before they are let go. Though rare, some kidnappings involve demanding ransom from families. 
  * There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity, in South Africa. 
  * Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently. They can: 
    * Start suddenly
    * Interrupt traffic, transportation, and other services 
    * Turn violent 


  * Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in South Africa must obtain special authorization to travel to many informal settlements (townships) in and around Cape Town. U.S. mission staff must use fully armored vehicles when visiting and visiting hours are limited to 10:00 -15:00 weekdays only.
