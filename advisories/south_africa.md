**Exercise increased caution** in South Africa due to **crime, terrorism, civil unrest,** and**kidnapping**. 

**Advisory summary:** Violent crime is common and includes robbery, rape, carjacking and mugging. There are also "smash-and-grab" attacks on vehicles. Violent crime is more common in the downtown areas of big cities, especially after dark. Kidnapping is a threat in South Africa. Kidnappers target U.S. citizens and other foreign travelers to steal money. Captors often force victims to withdraw cash or give online account passwords before they are let go. Though rare, some kidnappings involve demanding ransom from families. 

There is risk of terrorist violence, including terrorist attacks and other activity, in South Africa. Visit the U.S. Department of State's [country reports on terrorism](https://www.state.gov/country-reports-on-terrorism/) to learn more.  

Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently. They can: 

  * Start suddenly 
  * Interrupt traffic, transportation, and other services 
  * Turn violent 



Due to the risks, U.S. government employees working in South Africa __ must obtain special authorization to travel to many informal settlements (townships) in and around Cape Town. U.S. mission staff must use fully armored vehicles when visiting and visiting hours are limited to 10:00 -15:00 weekdays only.  

**If you decide to travel to South Africa:**

  * Avoid walking alone, especially after dark.  
  * Avoid demonstrations and crowds. 
  * Do not display signs of wealth, such as expensive watches or jewelry.  
  * Drive with doors locked and windows closed.  
  * Follow local authority instructions. 
  * Always carry a copy of your U.S. passport and visa (if applicable). Keep original documents in a secure location. 
  * Avoid visiting informal settlements (townships) unless you are with someone familiar with the area. 
  * Avoid driving outside of metropolitan areas at night, due to road hazards such as animals, broken down vehicles, and the potential to become a victim of crime.  
  * Stay aware of your surroundings. 
  * Stay alert in tourist spots. 
  * Have evacuation plans that do not rely on U.S. government assistance. 
  * Keep travel documents up to date and easily accessible.
